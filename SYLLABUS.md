## **Capstone Project: Personal Finance Web Application**

* **Frontend (Django)**: user accounts, templates, financial dashboards
* **Backend (FastAPI microservices)**: transactions, budgeting API
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational) + Redis (caching)
* **Async processing**: Celery for scheduled tasks (e.g., recurring bills)
* **Deployment**: Docker + AWS/Heroku
* **Security**: JWT auth, CSRF protection, rate limiting
* **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics, alerts

Deliverables:

* Full code repo
* Architecture diagram
* Test suite (unit + integration + e2e)
* Deployment guide
